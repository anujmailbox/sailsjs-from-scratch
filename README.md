# [Sails.js From Scratch][published url]
## Instructor: [Dan Wellman][instructor url]


Sails.js is designed to make it easy to build Node.js web apps. Like Ruby on Rails, it implements the MVC (model-view-controller) pattern and saves a lot of routine coding by emphasising convention over configuration. Sails.js is built to support the requirements of modern web apps: data-driven APIs and a flexible, service-oriented architecture. 

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Dan Wellman will show you how to use Sails.js to quickly and easily build scalable, realtime web applications. By following along, you'll learn to create APIs in Sails as well as how to use and to override many of its defaults. You'll also see how to connect a Sails API to an AngularJS front-end.


## Source Files Description

This repository contains the completed source code for the source project - an example Sails.js and AngularJS app.

You need to have Node.js installed. Once the source files are unpacked, from the command line cd into the directory that you unpacked the source files to and run the `npm install` command. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the app using `sails lift` in the command line.
